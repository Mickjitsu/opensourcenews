 Initial Django Setup
As a developer, I want to set up a new Django project, so I can create a structured backend framework for the website.
As a developer, I want to configure settings for the project (e.g., secret keys, allowed hosts), so the application runs securely and correctly. Along with all required dependencies
As a developer, I want to set up a virtual environment, so I can manage dependencies independently of the global system.

 Create Wireframes
As a designer, I want to create wireframes for the homepage, so I can visualize how users will interact with the main interface.
As a designer, I want to create wireframes for category and single post pages, so I can plan the layout for browsing and reading articles.
As a designer, I want to gather feedback on the wireframes, so I can make improvements before development begins.

Install Necessary Dependencies
As a developer, I want to install Django Allauth, so I can implement user authentication easily.
As a developer, I want to install PostgreSQL as a database backend, so the site can handle large-scale data efficiently.

User Authentication
As a user, I want to create an account using an email and password, so I can have a personalized experience.
As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it, so I can regain access to my account.
(Email address verification is set up but not enabled for the case of marking, so assessors can easily create accounts and test the app.)

Base HTML and Homepage View
As a user, I want to visit a visually appealing homepage, so I can quickly understand the websiteâ€™s purpose.
As a user, I want a navigation bar that links to key pages (e.g., categories, account), so I can explore the site easily.
As a developer, I want to create a reusable base HTML template, so I can ensure consistency across all pages.

Create Database Models for Commenting
As a user, I want to leave a comment on articles, so I can share my opinions with others.
As a user, I want to edit or delete my comments, so I can update or remove my contributions.
As a moderator, I want to approve or delete comments, so I can maintain a respectful community.

Create Database Models for Articles
As an author, I want to create, edit, and delete articles, so I can manage the content on the site.
As a user, I want to browse articles based on categories, so I can find content relevant to my interests.
As a user, I want to see the publication date and author information on an article, so I can trust its relevance and credibility.

Deploy Early on Heroku
As a developer, I want to deploy the project to Heroku during development, so I can test features in a production-like environment.
As a user, I want the site to be publicly accessible, so I can provide feedback during development.
As a developer, I want to configure Heroku to work with PostgreSQL, so I can align the database structure with production needs.

Set Up AWS for Image Hosting
As a developer, I want to integrate AWS S3 for image storage, so I can handle user-uploaded images efficiently.
As a user, I want the images on the site to load quickly and reliably, so I have a smooth browsing experience.
As an admin, I want image uploads to be secure, so I can prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

Create Further HTML Pages for Categories and Single Posts
As a user, I want a category page to list all articles under that category, so I can easily explore topics of interest.
As a user, I want a single post page to display the article content and comments, so I can read and interact with individual posts.
As a developer, I want these pages to inherit styles from the base template, so the design remains consistent across the site.


## Design
### Colour Scheme
For the website I decided to use a dark colour scheme all based of the charcoal background of the body, with different shades of a darker blue/navy for the nav bar and certain article elements on the index page. These article elements were also inverted to change upon hovering.
![contrast grid of colours](/documentation/colours.png)



### Typography
I chose to stick with a sans-serif font type for the entirety of the webpage as it is very clear and easy to read for all users.
### Imagery
The imagery used on this website is all dynamic depending on what the journalist/adminstrator has decided to use for the article. Due to this, we have used a small fixed image size for smaller devices as images can be uploaded in different resolutions and create an imbalance. This way, it means that images will stay relatively around the same size and not differentiate too much.

### Wireframes
I was unable to install balsamiq wireframing tool due to restrictions on the computer I am using, so I opted for a free tool online wireframe.cc . Although it was more difficult to use and didn't allow me plan as effectively as I would have liked, I made some rough wireframes for each page.

## Features

### Responsive Navigation Bar toggle
This code was the base code from bootstraps website allowing for a responsive navbar with a dropdown menu for categories.

### Article validation.
Validation to ensure that a new article is published (If not, then it is a draft and won't be shown), along with options to choose whether it should also be a headline in it's respected category or if it is a breaking news story that should be front and centre of the index page. Breaking news stories should be approved by the site owner before updating.

### Database relations
My project uses relation database models to ensure full functionality of the site. At the moment, the database is connected across two apps within the project. The articles app, which is the main app for the project contains the database models related to articles, comments, user voting and website categories.

The journalists database model which is hosted on the Contributors app, is used for registering journalist accounts. This app is not fully created as this is an upcoming feature, however the model is fully active and an integral part of the current project.

## Features to be Added
We are currently working on a feature for a dedicated UI for journalists. This will allow journalists to log on to the website directly and have their own dedicated page only visible to them, which contains their current posts and drafts, and will allow for them to edit/delete posts.

We will also enable a registration option for new users to request to become a journalist, which will require approval from an admin before continuing.

Further additions to logging on and accessing the platform will be added, with email confirmation being a necessity and not optional.

Email sign up:
Using a gmail account specifically for this project, along with built in django allauth features, we enabled email confirmation for users who sign up using email. At the moment, signing up via email is option however will be implemented in the future. Testing however can be done by adding your email address during registration, and you will receive a confirmation email and url.

## Testing

### Validation of Code
Index w3 validator
Due to the use of django, w3 validator was not used in this project

CSS Validator

Base html CSS

### Lighthouse
Lighthouse results, due to the nature of django projects and the dynamic use of images and URLs, many of the elements did not pass however accessibility and SEO maintained a very high rating.

![Lighthouse results for index page](/documentation/seo.png)
![Lighthouse results for index page](/documentation/accessibility.png)


Common issue seems to be with image size and type used for mobile versions of the website.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing
Wave testing - errors shown are due to the home link and home icon both directing to home, and the social media links only directing to the social websites and not a real profile
![Accessibility testing review from Wave](/documentation/wave.png)


### Manual Testing

Here I have tested all the features on each and every page of my website. Please see the results below.

Our goals are to ensure that the website is accessible, all links work and direct as expected, and each dynamic page populates correctly with correllated data from the database.

## Bug resolutions

When creating this project, I came across many bugs which proved difficult and time consuming to fix. The first of which was rendering images on the hosted application. When the application was set to Debug = True, the images would host normally however when in production and debug was set to false, this would fail to work.

To get around this, I created a bucket using AWS for storing images. This proved to be a major learning curve, with many images still failing to load even after connecting AWS to my project.

Primarily, the main issue would be that the project would not append 'media/' to the end of the aws bucket URL, even though this was clearly specified in the media URL of my project settings. After much trial and error, the best way around this I found was to move the media folders held up AWS up one level, so they were found directly at /articles/ rather than /media/articles, this allow for the urls on my website to get the correct images.

LAST MINUTE BUG RESOLUTION:
Just before submitting the project, an issue occurred on an already hosted version of the app which did not exist previously. Specifically the issue was that the media URL returned to not be recognised by the application, resulting in the mutliple pages returning an internal server error and failing to load. As this was very late at night and had just arose without changes being made, a quick fix was added by manually putting the sw bucket url infront of the image url variables used in the project, and removing the '.url' at the end of these variables. This results in just the path name for the images being used in rather than the full URL, and being appended on to the end of the hardcoded sw bucket url. This is not a perfect fix, however given the time at when the issue arose, it serves as a hot fix for the time being while further investigation is done.

**Cloning the repository**

To clone the repository, access the repository URL below.
https://github.com/Mickjitsu/opensourcenews/tree/main/opensourcenews

You well need to cd to the folder 'opensourcenews' within this project, and here you will be in the project directory.

As this project requires specific configurations to use, you will need to ensure that you add a Database URL and secret key to your env.py file if you plan to customise the web page. You will also need to install AWS if you plan to make the website into production.

Once you have cloned the repository, you can then add this information and launch the project with the comment 'python manage.py runserver'. Ensure to download all requirements by using the comment pip install -r requirements.txt.

**Forking the repository**

To Fork this repository and have a version of this on your personal account to make changes, customisation and amendments, please do the following.

Go to the GitHub page of the repository : https://github.com/Mickjitsu/opensourcenews/tree/main/opensourcenews
Click on the "Fork" button, usually found at the top-right corner of the page.

After forking, you will have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. You can then clone your forked version to your local machine by following the "Cloning the Repository" steps, using the URL of your fork.


## Deployment

**Deploying on Heroku**
To deploy on heroku, first make sure that you have your database url and secret key added and working to your env.py file, and ensure this is functioning correctly.   Ensure to download all requirements by using the comment pip install -r requirements.txt.

Once that is done, start your heroku project with your own repository of the cloned repo. Once that is done, go to the settings of your heroku app and choose the build python, and add your DB URL and secret key to the config vars.

When you plan to go to production and use an image hosting platform like AWS, you will also need to add your aws details as config vars here to ensure images hosted on AWS are made visible for users.

Much of the styling also came from bootstrap. Database came from CodeInstitute. The knowledge and parts of the code javascript code for enabling real time upvoting and downvoting and csrf token usage also came from assistance using OpenAI's chatGPT.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my partner for encouraging me to continue on when I was struggling at the start of the course, my family for encouraging me to keep studying despite going through a bereavement, and my mentor Matt for helping me along the way with pre, mid point and final calls. It has been an incredibly hard process to get here.
